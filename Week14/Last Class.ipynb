    "The better you are at Python and SQL, the easier your life will be when it comes to data collection, manipulation, and implementation. \n",
    "1. Learn how the SELECT statement works. This includes studying how Logical Query Processing works. Logical Query Processing describes the order in which the database engine executes the clauses of your SELECT statements. Understanding it will lead you to write better, more accurate queries.\n",
    "2. Study how joins work. Inner joins are the most efficient. Left, right, and full outer joins are less efficient, but sometimes you must use them. Inner joins can cause rows to be filtered out, outer joins cannot cause filtering. Study joins so you know when to use each type. Only the simplest database queries don’t involve joins.\n",
    "3. Understand how to conduct aggregations using the GROUP BY clause.\n",
    "4. Understand Window Functions / Ordered Analytical Functions. These are the epitome of conducting analytics within SQL. It will initially be hard to wrap your head around them, but it will be worth it. And once you understand them you will use them all the time.\n",
    "5. Understand database normalization. If you understand normalization, you will understand the theory of why architects structure databases the way they do. This helps while writing queries and determining which tables to join.\n",
    "6. Understand how Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) work. Most ERDs are built using the crow’s foot notation. Be sure to know how cardinality and optionality constraints work, which will help you decipher which join type to use when joining tables.\n",
    "7. Once you get up to speed with those things, you should probably expand into learning the DML & DDL subcategories of SQL. DML stand for Data Manipulation Language, which the SELECT statement is part of. DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is what database architects use to create tables. "
