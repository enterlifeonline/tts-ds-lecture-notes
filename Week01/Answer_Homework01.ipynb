    "6. An immutable object is an object that cannot be modified. That means once created its state cannot be changed. It will represent the same value once created. For Example — String is immutable in python. A string object will always represent the same value, it can’t be modified. For example — The string object ‘h’ will always represent the python value h. No matter what happens!First a pointed to the string \"Marissa\". Then you changed the variable a to point at a new string \"Marissa is the best\". You didn't actually mutate the string \"Marissa\". Strings are immutable, variables can point at whatever they want."
