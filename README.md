# DataScienceLectureNotes
This Repository will be available to all data science students for Tech Talent South 

# Welcome

My name is Marissa Robinson and I will be your intructor for this intro level Data Science Course. I myself am dedicated to making coding knowledge attainable to all ages. From the get go, I would like you to be fully aware of what you able to get out of this class. My three main goals are:
- My students are comfortable talking about the data science field in a technical and non technical sense 
- My students know how to search for answers to their data science questions 
- My students understand what skills are needed to build a strong foundation in data science 
- My students are able to build their own data science portfolio in Git Hub 
- My students are able to explain basic foundational python skills 
- My students are able to explain machine learning 

This is an 8 week course and it will fly by. I want to make sure you are geared and ready to continue learning on your own after this course is over. Expect to talk a lot. I will not be simply talking to you, my class is very interactive and be ready for me to ask you to share your screen at any point during the class. 

# The Flow 
A typica class day will be broken down as the following:
- **30 minutes:** Review material from previous class 
- **1 hour 15 minutes:** Learning Material 
- **15 minutes:** Break time 
- **30 minutes:** Practice what you just learned with a partner or small group
- **30 minutes:** Discussion Time 

# Homework 
For most of your homework assignments I will require you to simply put the link to your git hub repository. I should always be able to find your homwork in your git hub repo. I will always try my best to be able to complete homework assignemnts during class time. In addition, you will be assignmend podcast and readings to be done outside of class time.
