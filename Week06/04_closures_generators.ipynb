    "- If a word ends in S, X, or Z, add ES. Bass becomes basses, fax becomes faxes, and waltz becomes waltzes.\n",
    "- If a word ends in a noisy H, add ES; if it ends in a silent H, just add S. What’s a noisy H? One that gets combined with other letters to make a sound that you can hear. So coach becomes coaches and rash becomes rashes, because you can hear the CH and SH sounds when you say them. But cheetah becomes cheetahs, because the H is silent.\n",
    "- If a word ends in Y that sounds like I, change the Y to IES; if the Y is combined with a vowel to sound like something else, just add S. So vacancy becomes vacancies, but day becomes days.\n",

Combined, this regular expression tests whether noun ends with s, x, or z.\n",
